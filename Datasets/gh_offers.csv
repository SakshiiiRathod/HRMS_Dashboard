Roopali has been identified at Level 4 and Mid proficiency. She's immediately available to join us. She's currently holding an offer for 25L fixed + 1L JB but has been very keen about joining InMobi.

Proposing the starting range for Mid proficiency at 0.78 compa. It's set there because the increase is sizeable and we want to set her up at the right comp to grow. From a proficiency perspective she might be pegged even higher - but the increase is already sizeable.

Infact, we should be able to convert her with 28-30 LPA too but she will be pegged too low wrt our ranges and it will be difficult to move her up in the upcoming cycles.",Mid,,0,INR,,,,Q2,India - Inmobi Technology Services Private Limited,Bangalore,,,,21-05-2024

Hi,

 

I found this guy good for Southeast Asia as he has already work in an international environment and its timing. Also, he is good in comminucation.

He is not perfect in image editing but he is trainable.

Good from my end.
